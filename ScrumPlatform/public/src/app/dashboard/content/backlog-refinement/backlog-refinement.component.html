                <p>The product backlog is the master list made by the product owner that contains all the tasks necessary to create the product. Tasks will be listed as stories, and will have an estimation and priority. The product backlog will be changed throughout development, as the client adds or modifies requirements for the product.</p>

                <p>Paint a Room!<p>
                <p>For this exercise we will have the dev team go through and scrum the process of painting a room. Unlike in the typical scrum process we will have the dev team generate the product backlog. Take 5-10 minutes and individually write down the steps for painting a room in a house. Afterwards the group will come together and compare tasks and, as a group, decide which of the steps are needed to paint and place them in the product backlog. </p>
                <p>For our example we will start with the list below in the product backlog.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Measure the room</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Decide on a color</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Get supplies</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Prep the room for painting</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Paint the room</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clean up</p>
