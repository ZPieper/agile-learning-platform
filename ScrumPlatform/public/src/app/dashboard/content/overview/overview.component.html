      <h3>What is Agile?</h3>
      <p>Agile is the process all modern software companies use for the development of software.
        It is a management
        system which focuses on flexibility and collaboration over linear, sequential approaches.
        The main benefit of
        using the Agile process, is that it allows a company to go to the client throughout
        various stages of a products
        development to allow for review and revision. Agile uses 6 "deliverables" to keep track
        of a product throughout
        its life cycle.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s software developers were becoming increasingly frustrated with the standard
        project management
        process of the time. As clients became more demanding of a products content and
        expediency, software companies
        were finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with consumer demand. So, in 2001, 13
        discontent developers
        gathered together with a plan to create a new process to overcome the industries issues.
        And so, Agile was
        created.</p>
      <p><strong>The Deliverables:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Product vision statement-</strong> A summary that articulates the goals for
            the product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Product roadmap</strong> The high-level view of the requirements needed to
            achieve the product
            vision.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Product backlog</strong> Ordered by priority, this is the full list of what
            is needed to be done to
            complete your project.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Release plan</strong> A timetable for the release of a working product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Sprint backlog</strong> The user stories (requirements), goals, and tasks
            linked to the current
            sprint.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Increment</strong> The working product functionality that is presented to
            the stakeholders at the
            end of the sprint, and could potentially be given to the customer.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Several frameworks are used by developers within agile to create a product, but the most
        popular one in use
        today is Scrum.</p>

      <h3>What is Scrum?</h3>
      <p>Scrum is the actual development process that occurs during and agile cycle, and is made
        up of several Sprints.
        We will go into further detail as to what a Sprint is and how Scrum works, but for now
        just know that Scrum is a
        means of dividing a product into several tasks and assigning these tasks to various
        members of the dev team.
        What tasks a team focuses on first is determined by which Sprint they are in, and once
        all tasks and Sprints are
        completed, you have a finished product.</p>

      <h3>What to Expect from This Course</h3>
      <p>This course will take your group through the agile process. The course will contain
        quizzes, various exercises,
        as well as a final project that will entail your group creating a product for a client
        using the Agile/Scrum
        process. By the end of the course, you should have a much better understanding of how dev
        teams work and how
        projects are taken on and completed in the software industry.</p>
